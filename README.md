# Ecommerce-Microservices-SpringBoot


##  Overview
This project is a fully functional **E-commerce application** built using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud** following a **microservices architecture**.  
It was developed during my internship at **Ejada Systems Ltd. â€“ Egypt Branch** as part of my **Computer Science and Engineering** studies at GUC.

The application is split into multiple microservices that communicate through REST APIs, with service discovery, centralized configuration, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
